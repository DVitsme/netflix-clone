Okay real talk here I am just playing around lol. I have no clue what I am even doing here. 
What is my backend? Postgres? MongoDB? Hell if I know LOL! 

Is there even a back end?

Here is what I know

I want a client built on NextJs cause I hate building Clients without out...unless i'm getting paid then...w/e lol.

I want it to play movies..
* maybe I will host al videos on Vimeo and let that be the way...
* maybe host it on the server myself...okay this seems bad but its not for production anyway so do I care?

I need images
* I just saw with NextJs 10 there is this new Image component so that seems lit as hell. I will def use that maybe it will be like Gatsby's cause I like using that ALOT.

I need Auth
* Everything must have Auth(all hail JWT...or Passport(okay in re-reading this that is legit the same thing but w.e im talking to myself and my rubber duck here sue me)... or maybe I wont want to kill myself tonight messing with google.)

More to come for sure... Or i will work on this for one night and drop it, never pushing it to get hub and this README will never see the light of day. Prolly for the best.
